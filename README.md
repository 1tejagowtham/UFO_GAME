UFO

Itâ€™s game time!! 
Roll up your sleeves and play a game: UFO.

The premise:

Invaders from outer space have arrived and are abducting humans using tractor beams. Players must crack the codeword to stop the abduction!

Detailed information:

So our aim is to fill the codeword correctly.

It will display the incorrect guess by you, and the codeword to the extent you guessed correctly and rest with underscores suggesting empty letters to be filled with correct guesses.

The tractor beam of UFO pulls the person more into it with more incorrect guesses.

The game can tolerate only 7 incorrect guesses, and if incorrect guesses exceeds 7, you loose the game as we loose the person as the UFO pulls the person completely into it and leave from there.

It will ask you to enter the guess letter until the codeword is filled completely(with all the above conditions).

If you could complete the guesses correctly you win!!

So whats late compile and run the code to start the game.
